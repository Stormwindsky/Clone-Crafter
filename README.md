# Clone-Crafter


# About this mod:

 

This mod was supposed to be a horror mod with vanilla Minecraft mobs cloned by unknown aliens, but they're having trouble cloning them identically but I unfinished them :(

 

Since the mod is Unfinished it has just the Zombie Clones and Pig Clones but the partiuliarity of the Pig Clones is that it hunts you it more that it gets closer it has chance that it decides in the code to transform itself into true vanilla pig of Minecraft or to continue to attack you but the Zombie Clones had I did not finish them 100% their big difference is that it can run you towards you and it does not take fires during the day and it does not attack the Villagers
